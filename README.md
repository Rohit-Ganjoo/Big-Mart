# Big Mart Sales Prediction


## Project Overview


This project focuses on predicting sales figures for various products across different stores. Leveraging historical sales data, the goal is to develop a regression model that accurately forecasts product sales.

## Key Steps


## Data Loading:

Import the training and test datasets containing information about products, stores, and sales.



## Data Exploration:

Analyze the dataset to understand its structure, identify missing values, and explore statistical summaries.



## Data Preprocessing:

Handle missing values, remove outliers, and transform categorical data for model compatibility.



## Feature Engineering:

Create new features or modify existing ones to enhance the model's ability to capture relevant patterns.


## Model Training:

Choose a regression model (e.g., Linear Regression) and train it using the processed training dataset.




## Performance Evaluation:

Assess the model's performance using evaluation metrics such as Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE) or R-squared.



## Predictions on Test Data:

Apply the trained model to make predictions on the test dataset, generating sales forecasts.



## Results Analysis:

Analyze the predicted sales results and compare them with actual sales values to evaluate model accuracy.
